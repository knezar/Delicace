Once you have everything mixed well, go ahead and rub all over your cuts of meat. Cover with Saran Wrap and place in the fridge to marinade anywhere from 1 to 3 hours.When you are ready to grill, take a cast iron skillet and start sauteing your veggies you want to eat on your fajitas. I chose a red onion thinly sliced, and a red and orange bell pepper, also thinly sliced with a Tbsp of Olive Oil to saute them in. (Have your grill set at 350 degrees.)When your onions start becoming translucent and you have everything close to ready, it's time to grab those marinating skirt steaks and put them on the grill",
